# DiscordGuess
This tool allows you to guess the Discriminator of Discord accounts (the numbers at the end) based on their Username. It uses the "Add Friend" feature to test for valid Discord Tags.

## Notes
* You will need your Token to be able to send valid requests.
* Discord has a 10 requests/minute rate limit on the Add Friend function. Rate limiting delays are implemented, but use a 10 second delay to avoid suspicion.
